## About

The University of Waterloo Public Data API allows anyone to build applications using data from curated University of Waterloo datasets.

## License
- There is no explicit license for version 3 of the API. At present, it is covered by existing University policy, including, but not exclusively [Policy 46 - Information Management](https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policies/policy-46-information-management) and provided on an as-is, best case basis.

## Disclaimer
- If building services upon this data, please inform your users of the inherent risks (as a best practice). It is the goal that version 3 datasets will not require this disclaimer, and the data can be treated as reviewed and authoritative where possible.
